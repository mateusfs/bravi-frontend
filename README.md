# Frontend-Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4.

# Getting Started

Balanced Brackets

Write a function that takes a string of brackets as the input, and determines if the order of the
brackets is valid. A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ),
{, }, [, or ].
We say a sequence of brackets is valid if the following conditions are met:
● It contains no unmatched brackets.
● The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is
also a matched pair of brackets.
Examples:
● (){}[] is valid
● [{()}](){} is valid
● []{() is not valid
● [{)] is not valid

Contact List Backend

Create a REST API which will store people and their contacts. A person can have multiple
contacts such as phone, email or whatsapp. The API should allow to create, update, get and
delete both the people and the contacts.

Contact List Frontend

Create a web app which explores the API built in the second assignment. You are expected
to use Angular 4, TypeScript, Angular CLI and SASS. The UI design is totally up to you.


## Install server

Run `npm install` for a dev install for depences of the source files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
